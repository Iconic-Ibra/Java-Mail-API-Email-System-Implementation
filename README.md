# Java-Mail-API-Email-System-Implementation
## This Java code sends an email by using the Java Mail API. It starts by setting up the email server properties such as the host, port, and authentication credentials. It then creates a Session object with these properties and uses it to create a MimeMessage object representing the email. The recipient email address, subject, and body are set on this message object, and then the message is sent using the Transport.send method. The code also provides a main method that invokes the sendEmail method to demonstrate how to use it.
